#  Cricket Data Cleaning and Preparation

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a **raw cricket dataset** for further analysis and visualization. The dataset contained inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues, which were systematically addressed using **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** in **Jupyter Notebook**.

The cleaned dataset is now ready for use in performance analytics, trend detection, and predictive modeling.

##  Steps in Data Cleaning

1. **Data Inspection**
   - Loaded the raw cricket dataset and explored its structure using `df.info()` and `df.describe()`.
   - Checked for missing and duplicate records.

2. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Filled or dropped missing entries based on the context of each variable.

3. **Duplicate Removal**
   - Identified and removed duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.

4. **Column Renaming and Standardization**
   - Renamed columns to meaningful names for readability.
   - Standardized categorical data formats (e.g., player names, match types).

5. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created derived columns such as strike rate and total runs for deeper insights.

6. **Exporting Clean Data**
   - Saved the clean dataset for future analysis or visualization in Power BI or Excel.
